# GRPC TEMPLATE

Template repository of a basic grpc server written in rust.

## Setup repository for development

Inside the repository you can find the ```temaplate_setup.sh``` script that will setup the repository for development

```bash
# Make the script runnable
chmod +x template_setup
./template_setup.sh
```

The script will use the current directory name to rename the ```template``` files and variables.
The directory should be named using camel case notation.
